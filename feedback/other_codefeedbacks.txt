Hi team,


These are the comments i have after the review of commits made so far to RentAgreement repositories
draggable form elements are duplicated if added after <hr> in the form  (need to set dimensions for draggable component to avoid this)
error while sending post request (POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/Forms/store 500 (Internal Server Error))(fid missing in client DB please check columns in DB)
Validations should be added to the from fields in template info (1st step of the form)
Will update if there are any other issues that need to be resolved.

Thank you ,
Rahul Kumar Korada.
